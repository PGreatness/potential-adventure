# Discord Bot: Potater-Bot (Save Point)
This handy little bot comes with many commands that make it a great addition to any discord server!
The last working and non-bugged version goes here.

Files bot-settings.json and user-settings.json must be provided in the same directory for the bot to work.
Nodemon must be installed as well.
